# arduino-2k19

These are source files that may be helpful when working on an Arduino SoC, which include the use of LEDs, servo motors, etc.

I'd also like to note that my final project (as well as what I consider my best work) is a Snake game using an 8x8 display and 4 buttons representing 4-directional input.

Unfortunately, I no longer remember most of the details on bringing this specific project to life. Still, I believe that saving my past works involving the use of Arduino SoCs into a git repository is the least I could do.
